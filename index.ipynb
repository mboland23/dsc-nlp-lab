    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***Newsgroups Dataset*** is a collection of [newsgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup) posts originally collected around 1995. While the backend code implementation is fairly different, you can think of them as like the Reddit posts of 1995, where a \"category\" in this dataset is like a subreddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to try to identify the category where a post was published, based on the text content of the post.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of what you are practicing here is using the `sklearn.datasets` submodule, which you have seen before (e.g. the Iris Dataset, the Wine Dataset). You can see a full list of available dataset loaders [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we will be using the `fetch_20newsgroups` function ([documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups.html)). An important thing to note is that because this is text data, scikit-learn actually downloads a set of documents to the computer you are using to complete this lab, rather than just loading data into memory in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to preprocessing, every row in the dataset only contains one feature: a string containing the full text of the newsgroup post. We will perform preprocessing to create additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have guessed based on the function name, there are 20 categories in the full dataset. Here is a list of all the possible classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='classes.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "This full dataset is quite large. To save us from extremely long runtimes, we'll work with only a subset of the classes. For this lab, we'll work with the following five:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'comp.windows.x'`\n",
    "* `'rec.sport.hockey'`\n",
    "* `'misc.forsale'`\n",
    "* `'sci.crypt'`\n",

    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Load the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pandas and `sklearn.datasets` to load the train and test data into appropriate data structures. Then get a sense of what is in this dataset by visually inspecting some samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Perform Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis with `nltk`\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardize the case of the data and use a tokenizer to convert the full posts into lists of individual words. Then compare the raw word frequency distributions of each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Build and Evaluate a Baseline Model with `TfidfVectorizer` and `MultinomialNB`\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately all data must be in numeric form in order to be able to fit a scikit-learn model. So we'll use a tool from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` to convert all data into a vectorized format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially we'll keep all of the default parameters for both the vectorizer and the model, in order to develop a baseline score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Iteratively Perform and Evaluate Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will investigate three techniques, to determine whether they should be part of our final modeling process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Removing stopwords\n",
    "2. Using custom tokens\n",
    "3. Domain-specific feature engineering\n",
    "4. Increasing `max_features`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Evaluate a Final Model on the Test Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have chosen a final modeling process, fit it on the full training data and evaluate it on the test data. "

As you've seen throughout this section, preprocessing text data is a bit more challenging that working with more traditional data types because there's no clear-cut answer for exactly what sort of preprocessing we need to do. As we are preprocessing our text data, we need to make some decisions about things such as:\n",

    "Let's begin with the first question: ***do we remove stopwords or not?*** In general we assume that stopwords do not contain useful information, but that is not always the case. Let's empirically investigate the top word frequencies of each category to see whether removing stopwords helps us to distinguish between the catogories.\n",
    "\n",
    "As-is, recall that the raw word frequency distributions of 4 out of 5 categories look very similar. They start with `the` as the word with by far the highest frequency, then there is a downward slope of other common words, starting with `to`. The `misc.forsale` category looks a little different, but it still has `the` as the top token.\n",
